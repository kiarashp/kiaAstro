title: "Meditrack: AI Medicine Tracker"
publishDate: 2025-06-10
desc: "I built Meditrack, a web app that helps users recognize and track their medicines. Users can log in with Google, take or upload a photo of a medicine, and the system uses AI to detect and identify it. Identified medicines can be saved to a personal profile for easy tracking. I developed the full stack using SvelteKit for the frontend, Supabase for authentication and database management, and the OpenAI GPT API for intelligent image-to-text detection. This project demonstrates my ability to integrate authentication, AI APIs, and cloud databases into a seamless, user-friendly product."
