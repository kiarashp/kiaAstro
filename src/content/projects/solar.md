### Overview

**Solar Power Website** is a bilingual (Persian and English) platform designed for a solar energy company to promote and sell its services.  
The project’s focus was to provide a modern, accessible, and responsive interface while supporting seamless language switching for different audiences.

### Tech Stack

- **Next.js** — for a performant, SEO-friendly, and scalable frontend  
- **Strapi CMS** — as a flexible headless backend to manage dynamic bilingual content  
- **i18n** — for effortless multi-language functionality (English & Persian)  
- **TypeScript** — ensuring reliability and maintainability of the codebase  
- **Tailwind CSS** *(optional if you used it)* — for clean and responsive styling  

### Features

- Dual-language support (EN/FA) with instant switching  
- CMS-driven content management through Strapi  
- Responsive design optimized for mobile and desktop  
- SEO-friendly architecture with server-side rendering  
- Easy scalability for future services or product additions  

### Outcome

This project deepened my understanding of **internationalization (i18n)** and **headless CMS integration**.  
I successfully built a professional bilingual platform that demonstrates strong attention to usability, accessibility, and modern frontend best practices.
