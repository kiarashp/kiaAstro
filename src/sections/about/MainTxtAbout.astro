      About Me
    </h3>
    <p class="text-base-content/80 leading-relaxed">
      I'm a web developer focused on building fast, reliable, and modern
      websites using frameworks like SvelteKit, Next.js, and Astro. I enjoy
      connecting front-end applications with tools like Strapi, WordPress, and
      Supabase to create dynamic, full-stack experiences. My goal is to turn
      ideas into clean, functional, and maintainable web solutions — without
      overcomplicating design, but with a strong focus on structure,
      performance, and real-world results.
